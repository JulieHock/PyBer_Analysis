# PyBer_Analysis

## Overview of the Analysis

PyBer has collected a lot of data on the different cities it offers its ride share.  Each ride is collected and stored within the ride_data.csv and each city collects data and stored in the city_data.csv.  We were asked to combine this data to one DataFrame to find the total ries, total drivers, total fares, average fare per ride and average fare per driver all broken down by the different types of cities (urban, suburban and rural).  We will then look further in to the data to see how these different city types compare to each other and make recommendations.


## The Results

When the data was combined, we calculated a total of 2,375 total rides, split among Rural (125 rides), Suburban (625 rides) and Urban(1,625 rides).  There were a total of 2973 drivers, with 78 in Rural, 490 in Suburban and 2,405 in Urban.  The Rural type has the smallest rides, drivers, and fares; however, they had the highest average fare per ride and highest average fare per driver.  This is probably due to people in the rural areas traveling farther to get places than people in urban settings.  The Suburban was in the middle for total fares, but had the second highest average fare per ride and average fare per driver.  Even though Urban had the largest total fares, it had the smallest average fare per ride and average fare per driver.  Again, this is probably due to people not needing to travel as far in a city (urban) setting.
